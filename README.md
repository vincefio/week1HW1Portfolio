# week1HW1Portfolio

This was a good review for me in terms of HTML and CSS.  At the beginning I was
using flexbox for the columns, contact form and trying it out for the nav bar,
which led to some cool discoveries on responsive navbars.

Going over floats again was a big help, as they come up often in web design

Toughest part of this was the portfolio page and the labels on top of the
images.  I was overcomplicating the amount of divs i needed surrounding the
image and the h3 tags.
